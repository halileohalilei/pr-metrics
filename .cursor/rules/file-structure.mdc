# General

Keep TypeScript types in .types.ts files.
Except the files that need to be in certain directories like `app` for Next.js's app router, all source code files need to be under `src`.

# Components
Each component should have its own directory with the name of the component.
No inline styling.
The component should be exported from an index.ts file, but DO NOT do barrel imports. If anything else needs to be exported from a component module, it should not be exported from the index.ts file.
Each component should comprise of this strcutre:
 - ComponentName.tsx
 - index.ts
 - ComponentName.styles.ts (in case there is any custom styling for the component)
 - ComponentName.types.ts (in case types need to be defined for the component)
 - components/ (in case there are subcomponents required for the component to make things more modular.)
